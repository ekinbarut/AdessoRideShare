Rideshare REST API

A more than required REST API implementation for an interview case that had a time limit of 8 hours for the analysis, design, implementation and tests. Took this as more of a challenge than a basic implementation. Please join me in making fun of the shitty code.

The requirements were:
 
Scenario 1:
* Drivers should be able to list/unlist their travel plans
* Travelers should be able to search travel plans with From and To parameters
* Travelers should be able to send participation requests until all the available seats are full.

Scenario 2:
* When the travelers choose their ride, they should be able to see which countries the ride will go through

Tl;dr: Didn't get the job
